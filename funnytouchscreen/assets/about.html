	How to play</br>
	-------------- </br></br>
	
	"Funny touchscreen" is a set of two simple games with four levels of difficulty. This
	should explain 8 buttons on the main screen :-). Games are intended for small
	children (2 - 5 years). </br></br>
	
	In the first game user clicks on buttons and they disappear. When all buttons are
	gone, next round (with more buttons) is started. Easiest difficulty level allows user
	to click on any button, the most difficult level requires to click in the order
	specified by numbers. There are four different levels for different age. </br></br>
	
	In the second game user picks two buttons of the same kind and then they disappear.
	Game is again available in four difficulty levels. Buttons has same colors or same
	numbers, etc. </br></br>
